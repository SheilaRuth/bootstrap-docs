Bootstrap Docs
==============
Get access to all the documentation from the previous versions of
Twitter Bootstrap, all in one place!

Necessary Modifications
-----------------------
Some things were rejigged to work these things into a neat structure -
relative paths, file locations, etc. - so the source of the
documentation here is **not** the same as what you'll get in the
tarball.

Some fixes were also applied to the Github buttons found in the
headers from **v2.0** onwards. Instead of removing them, the new ones
from [ghbtns.com](http://ghbtns.com) are used instead, as in
**v2.1.0**.

Why?
---
Because it's nice to have them accessible and readable online, in one
place. And it's frustrating when the docs from the previous version 
disappear the *second* a new version is released. They will live forever
here.

Anything else?
--------------
Patches welcome as newer versions get released, or if there are any
issues with the older ones. A nice way to automate most of it would be
nice. The documentation since **v2.0** has been pretty self-contained, thankfully.
